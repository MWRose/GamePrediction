<h1>NFL Outcomes</h1>


<h3>Description</h3>
<p>This project is to create a outcome predictor for NFL football games. This would be done by pulling data from previous years, previous games, or specific game day data. Ideally, this would be more than just wins and losses but also estimated score. One of the goals for this project would be to bring in more information than just the basic stats</p>

<p>Prior data might be</p>
<ul>
	<li>Win loss record</li>
	<li>Historical record against the team</li>
	<li>Home/away record</li>
	<li>Season run/pass yards (or allowed)</li>
</ul>

<p>There is also the oppurtunity to pull in non NFL specific game day data such as</p>
<ul>
	<li>Weather</li>
	<li>Twitter sentiments</li>
	<li>Time of day</li>
</ul>
<p>but some of these would take considerable time and work to consolidate. If we did bring this information, probably a lot of the effort would be compiling a new dataset that includes the specific data for each game.</p>

<p>One challenge is that while a random program would only guess right 50% of the time, many programs could probably guess better than this just using a decision tree of wins and losses or other similar statistics. This is why I believe it would be interesting to introduce betting line data for each matchup, that may already have a lot of this information built in. Then instead of only predicting wins and losses, the nueral network would seek to maximize profits. However, this introduces some ethical concerns around gambling and using a computer to do so, so this project would include a consideration of that.</p>

<h3>Goals</h3>
<ul>
	<li>Predict games correctly more than 50% of the time</li>
	<li>Use NNs to analyze betting lines and payouts to make a profit</li>
	<li>Explore the ethics of creating a system that can profit by betting</li>
	<li>Include additional information outside of just sports statistics</li>
</ul>
